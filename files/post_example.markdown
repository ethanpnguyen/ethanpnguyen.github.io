You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I decided to make this post to reflect on each year of my college experience. Today marks two months since UT's university-wide commencement, and it already feels so distant. College was the best time of my life and I want something to remember it by.

# Year 1

I entered freshman year with no clue what I was doing. I came from a small high school with only 87 students in the graduating class. My high school experience was a blast - I played 4 sports, didn't try in school, and still got good grades. Luckily, I was accepted into most of the colleges that I applied to (thanks mom for editing all of my essays and screw you U of M). My final decision came down to the University of Texas and Boston University. However, I had grown up in Boston all of my life and my mom worked at Boston University, so any sort of deliberation was short-lived. I committed to UT, becoming the first person from my high school to be accepted to and to attend the best school in Texas.

- roommate, frat

Before getting to UT, I chose to major in mechanical engineering - little did I know how hard it was to switch majors, especially with how poorly I performed in my first semester. Nonetheless, I was excited to have some sort of academic freedom. I met with the MechE academic advisor on my first visit, and the opportunities seemed endless.


# Year 2

- covid

- lifting

- financial eng


# Year 3

- increase fraternity role

- financial eng wouldnt word

- start trying in school


# Year 4

- keep going

- ditch the frat, stress less

- projects/classes are fun, realize what I want to do


# Reflecting

- i couldve done better, but i never faced that sort of difficulty in high school

- lesson for the future

- in the moment... -->
