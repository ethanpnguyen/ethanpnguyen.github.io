# About me

Hi! My name is Ethan Nguyen. I am a 4th year at The University of Texas at Austin. I will be graduating this spring with a **Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering** and minors in **Business Foundations** and **Computational Science and Engineering**. I made this website to document my data science projects and to make infrequent blog posts.

My interests include data science, software engineering, and financial engineering. I have recently accepted an offer as a **Systems Test Engineer at Raytheon Missiles and Defense**. I hope to expand on my technical skillset before I go to graduate school in DS/CS or transition to a full on tech role.

Outside of school, you can find me rooting for the Texas Longhorns or on the golf course (+15 handicap btw). Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or email me if you want to chat!
